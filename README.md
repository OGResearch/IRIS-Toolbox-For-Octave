IRIS Macroeconomic Modeling Toolbox for GNU Octave

IRIS is a free, open-source toolbox for macroeconomic modeling and forecasting in MatlabÂ® and GNU Octave. In a user-friendly command-oriented environment, IRIS integrates core modeling functions (including a flexible model file language which supports an automated code creation, a variety of tools for simulation, estimation, forecasting and model diagnostics, practical techniques for judgmental adjustments, and so on) with a supporting infrastructure (including time series analysis, data management and reporting).

This version is supposed to work with the official GNU Octave starting version 4.2.1.
