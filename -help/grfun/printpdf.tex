	\paragraph{Syntax}
 
 \begin{verbatim}
 printpdf(FileName)
 printpdf(Fig,FileName)
 \end{verbatim}
 
 \paragraph{Input arguments}
 
 \begin{itemize}
 \item
   \texttt{FileName} {[} char {]} - File name (without extension) to
   which the figure window will be printed in PDF format.
 \item
   \texttt{Fig} {[} handle {]} - Figure window that will be printed to
   PDF.
 \end{itemize}
 
 \paragraph{Description}
 
 The function \texttt{printpdf} prints a figure window to a PDF by first
 creating a color EPS file and then using the \texttt{epstopdf} utility
 to convert the EPS to the final PDF. The Painters renderer is used in
 the Matlab \texttt{print} command.
 
 The advantage of printing a PDF via EPS with Painters is to crop the
 unnecessary white margins around the graphics.
 
 \paragraph{Example}
 
 \begin{verbatim}
 plot(rand(15));
 printpdf('myfigure');
 \end{verbatim}
