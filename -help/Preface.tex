\section *{Preface}

IRIS is a Matlab\raisebox{0.3em}{\tiny\textregistered} toolbox for macroeconomic modeling, developed by the IRIS Solutions Team since 2001. It is free, open-source software distributed under BSD licence terms. The current version of IRIS runs in Matlab R2010a or later.

IRIS has been designed as an integrated software package to support the development and operation of macroeconomic models and model-based analytical systems. To that end, the toolbox integrates core modeling functions (such as a flexible model file language, tools for simulation, estimation, forecasting, or model diagnostics) with supporting infrastructure (such as time series analysis, data management, or reporting) in a user-friendly command-oriented environment.

This document is a reference manual, not a user's guide or tutorial. Check out the website, \texttt{www.iris-toolbox.com}, for a number of tutorials covering a range of different topics.
